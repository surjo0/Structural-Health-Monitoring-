## 🌟 Features
- **High Accuracy:** Achieves 92% accuracy in defect detection.
- **Fully Automated:** From data collection to deformation visualization.
- **Scalable:** Works with diverse structural geometries, from simple walls to complex forms.
- **Actionable Insights:** Generates heatmaps and detailed reports for quick interpretation.

## 📖 Methodology Overview
1. **Data Collection:** Capture high-resolution TLS data for precise 3D measurements.
2. **Preprocessing:** Filter out non-structural elements (e.g., trees, ground surfaces).
3. **Shape Detection:** Use geometric modeling to identify structural shapes like planes and cylinders.
4. **Deformation Analysis:** Employ ML regression to quantify deviations and flag defects.
5. **Visualization:** Create heatmaps and graphs to highlight problem areas.
